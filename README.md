# Fox Bot
Please note that this bot no longer works (Discord API updates). <br>
However, it can still be used as an example for its use of lists, indexing, and web-scraping. <br>
SongLyrics.py is the prototype, and can be run by itself locally. FoxBot itself can no longer run nor take commands. <br>
